# 🫀 Heart Disease Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **Heart Disease dataset** and visualizing key insights using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard provides a clear view of survival, death events, and health conditions across different **age groups** and **genders**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To analyze heart disease patient records.  
- To identify patterns between **age, gender, diabetes, and cancer** with survival/death rates.  
- To provide decision-makers (doctors/health researchers) with insights to improve preventive care.  

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
- **Alive %** → 68.04%  
- **Average Age of Alive Patients** → 58.83  
- **Total Alive** → 132 patients  
- **Total Deaths** → 62 patients  

### Key Visuals:
- **Total Death Event** – By Age Group  
- **Total Alive with Cancer** – Trend over age groups  
- **Total Alive by Age Group** – Patient count across groups  
- **Total Alive and Diabetes Cases** – Overlapping condition insights  
- **Gender Filter** – Male/Female patient comparison  


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – Data visualization  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning & transformation  
- **DAX** – Calculated measures for KPIs  

## 📑 Dataset
- Dataset: **Heart Disease Dataset**  

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open the `.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop**  
3. Explore and interact with the visuals

## 📌 Insights & Outcomes
- Majority of patients are **alive (~68%)**, especially in **middle-aged groups**.  
- Higher death events observed in **older patients (71+)**.  
- **Diabetes** is a significant contributing factor to deaths.  
- Cancer patients have lower survival rates in certain age groups.
